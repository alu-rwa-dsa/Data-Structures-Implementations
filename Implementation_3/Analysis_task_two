--- Time and Space complexity analysis of the Dynamic Array class ---

Method 1: add(value)
Time complexity O(1): adding an element to the end of the dynamic array happens in constant time because
there are operations needed to copy or shift any elements.
Space complexity O(1): adding an element doesn't require any


Method 2: delete(ind)
Time complexity O(1): deleting the last element in the list doesn't requires only one operation, so it happens in
constant time.
Space complexity O(1): the operation doesn't require any space to be done.
