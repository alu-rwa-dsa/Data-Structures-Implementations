--- Time and Space complexity analysis of the Array class ---

Method 1: Set(value, ind)
Time complexity O(n): setting an element in specific index takes linear time in the worst case if we have n elements
and we set a new value to index 0, then we will need to shift all the n elements.
Space complexity O(1): setting an element in specific index doesn't require any extra space so, it takes
constant space.


Method 2: get(ind)
Time complexity O(1): getting an element given the index takes constant time because one of the array features in
storing the indexes of its elements.
Space complexity O(1): getting an element using its index doesn't require any extra space so, it takes
constant space.


Method 3: len()
Time complexity O(1): getting the length of the array doesn't require any loops because the array size is
is stored by default in the array memory.
Space complexity O(1): getting the stored length happens in constant time.
